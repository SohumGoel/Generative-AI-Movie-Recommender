## Recommendation Techniques

The app incorporates multiple approaches for content recommendation:  
1. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on attributes like genres, cast, and crew.  
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverages user preference patterns to suggest movies enjoyed by similar users.  
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines content-based and collaborative methods for comprehensive recommendations.  
4. **Embedding-Based Search**: Uses vector embeddings to identify semantic similarities between movies and user inputs, enabling recommendations for nuanced content relationships.
